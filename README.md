Montag
======

If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.
                                                                        Isaac Asimov

Montag is intended to be a means to cheap and widely available education. In the 21th century
knowledge is the raw material without which success in life (however success may be defined in the readers culture)
becomed virtually impossible to attain.
Even though Article 13 of the United Nations' 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the right of everyone to an education economical, cultural and political circumstances often make it hard
for people to actually obtain one.

The main idea behind Montag is to leverage the virtually nonexistent delivery cost for digital documents (think e-books,
tutorials, guides) to increase the availability of written information for as many human being as possible.
